Extra:
setup fire location

when an agent close to the fire, his health will be decreased until 0, then he is dead
when an agent go toward the fire, we should remove all exits in the same directions in one tick (not always)

Select top 3 closest exists and choose one randomly

people can not go outside the train from side to another
Fix walls in the train 
Fix fire spreading when it is near seats (spread faster)
Graph for health and for dead people
Graph for the sensitivity of fire
=========
Look AHEAD example.	? 
Slider for faster movement(forword)
========================
What to do?
Moving passenger function:
	- They should NOT go into fire	? 	
	- They should NOT go toward fire ? 
	- They should try to find the exits and closest doors (Either color or Coodinates)		OK 
	- If fire burn passengers or staff, they are died.	? 
	- people who touch the first or grey, their health attribute will be decreased. 	?
========================
Moving staff function:
	- Staff should move and pick one fire-distinguisher 
	- They go towards fire and stop the fire by changing the color to white.
========================
Add Panic rate to passengers:
	- Some of them will move randomly without target and others will move in good path to targets.
=======================

From teacher:
* Prob. of fire spreading
* Probagation to get panic if close to fire
* Assume that staff-members have fire distinguisher 
* Relation between nb-people safe & nb-staff 
* Social graph (add children)
