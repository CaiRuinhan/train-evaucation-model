;; TURTLE STRATEGY #2:
;; Check neighboring patches to see if any are empty.  If any are
;; empty, pick a random empty one and move onto its center.
;; Note that we can't just do "fd 1", since the patch's center
;; might be more than 1 unit away from our current position.

to go-if-empty-nearby
  ask turtles [
    let empty-patches neighbors with [not any? turtles-here]
    if any? empty-patches
      [ let target one-of empty-patches
        face target
        move-to target ]
  ]
  tick
end

;; TURTLE STRATEGY #3:
;; Keep moving forward until standing on an empty patch.  (The
;; Segregation model in the Models Library uses a variant of
;; this strategy.)  Note that theoretically this could end up
;; stuck in an infinite loop if all the patches the turtle
;; crosses are always occupied, but this is very unlikely
;; to happen in practice.

to go-until-empty-here  ;; turtle procedure
  ask turtles [
    fd 1
    while [any? other turtles-here]
      [ fd 1 ]
  ]
  tick
end
